# About
This application acts like a shuffled stack data structure, and also allows you to:
- Choose the range of numbers for your list
- Save to disk 
- Remove a number or add back a removed number

Just use the requirements.txt file to install the dependencies via pip and then run the RandomListPop.py file

# Languages and Tools
- Python 3.12 (Confirmed to work with as old as Python 3.7 as long as pip is updated)
- PyQt5
- Qt Designer
- randomdict (4 character addition fix version supplied by me, all credit to https://github.com/robtandy/randomdict)

Note: If you are using an older version of Python and randomdict installs via pip with no errors, you can discard the randomdict.py file supplied here.
